# Sevinç Öztürk

I am a visiting fellow at the University of Glasgow and an assistant professor of political science and international relations at Çukurova University. I received my PhD in Political Science from Rutgers University.
My research mainly focuses on authoritarian politics, political behavior and attitudes of minorities, and Turkish politics. I conduct experiments and observational analysis.
